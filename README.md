-created React app
-using wagmi library

-created connect button
-current network displayed

-began using useContractRead() to display erc20 token balance

-need to create input for token address and conenct to above function, currently contract address is hardcoded
-need to display contract info once contract address is input
-need to use useContractWrite() to provide ability to transfer token to other address

-need to add WalletConnect

-this will be the initial version. Ideally we use something like dexscreener.com to search token contracts regardless of network

-also we should create the option to display all tokens currently in connected wallet
-erc20 first then erc721/1155 later on...
