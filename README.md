-created React app
-using wagmi library

-created connect button
-current network displayed

-token search box displayed and functioning

-displays balance, token name and symbol (displays ETH by default)

-transfer function working, input token amount and recipient required (errors need to be handled better, also only can send ERC20 tokens right now, cannot send network coin ei- ETH)

-need to add WalletConnect

-this will be the initial version. Ideally we use something like dexscreener.com to search token contracts regardless of network
-also we should create the option to display all tokens currently in connected wallet (similar to zapper.fi
